## FizzBuzz using R 

- I made this repository to solve the problem of FezzBuzz using R; this problem asks you to create a function that can define if the number is divisible by three or not also if the number is derivable by five or not. 

- We merge the functions of fizz and the function of buzz in one function we call it fizzbuzz.

-  there is a function called Both the purpose of it is to check whether the numbers in each column have the same length or not to create a matrix of the resulting fizz , buzz, and fizzbuzz.

- All codes are written in R
